 * DFX - "Drum font exchange format" - source code
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2020 by Bryan Flamig
 *
 * This software helps facilitate the real-time playing of multi-layered drum
 * samples, by implementing a language that specifies a master directory of the
 * the sample wave files for a drum kit: where the samples are, what they are
 * for, and a summary of their properties. The DFX format allows modifications
 * of sample levels to achieve a unified, pleasing mix of sounds. Mechanisms
 * such as velocity layers and round robins are supported for this purpose.
 *
 * This exchange format has a one to one mapping to the widely used Json syntax,
 * simplified to be easier to read and write. It is easy to translate DFX files
 * into Json files that can be parsed by any software supporting Json syntax.
